Data for the paper "Optimal Search Space Pruning in Complex Strategic Problems"

The data_files directory includes two files:
optimalSearchSpacePruning_data.xlsx : the main sheet includes the data from the user study, where each row corresponds to a user's action. 
A legend explaining the columns is in the "legend" sheet.

raw_logs_study.csv: contains the raw data logs from the experiment. Each row corresponds to a logged event (participant action/response to a question). 
Note that events in the raw log file are not necessarily seperated by participants.
